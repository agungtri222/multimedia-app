# This is Explanation for some new functionality

    const  handleDelete  = () => {

        if (selectedFile) {

    	    const  newFiles  =  myFiles.filter((item) =>  item.id  !==  selectedFile.id);

    	    setMyFiles(newFiles);

    	    setSelectedFile(null);

        }

    };

and you can use the function within your component like below.

    <button  style={styles.controlButton}  onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</button>

In this example, we have a `myFiles` state that represents a list of files. Each file object has an `id` and `name`. The `selectedFile` state keeps track of the currently selected file.

The `handleDelete` function is triggered when the "Delete" button is clicked. It removes the selected file from the `myFiles` array using the `filter` method. Then, it updates the state with the new array and resets the `selectedFile` state to `null`.

Note that you should define the `styles.controlButton` object with the desired styles for your button, such as the background color, font size, etc.

Feel free to adapt this code to fit your specific use case and incorporate it into your React component.
